# Reactive Flows #

Reactive Flows is a demo project showing a Reactive web app built with:

- Scala
- Akka
- Akka Cluster Sharding
- Akka Data Replication
- Akka HTTP
- Akka Persistence
- Akka SSE (Server-Sent Events)
- AngularJS

## Usage

- Important: Reactive Flows makes use of [advanced JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find) which isn't yet available in Chrome, so make sure to use Firefox or Safari
- Before starting the app, you have to start MongoDB (>2.6.x) for Akka Persistence
- To run the first node, execute `rf1` in an sbt session; you can shutdown the app with `reStop`
- To run further nodes, execute `sbt rf2` or `sbt rf3` from the command line; stop the app with `CTRL+C`
- As the names and labels of the flows aren't persisted, you have to create them after the app has started; see below examples
