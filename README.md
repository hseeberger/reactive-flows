# Reactive Flows #

Reactive Flows is a demo project showing a Reactive web app built with:

- Akka Actors
- Akka HTTP
- Akka SSE (server-sent events)
- Akka Distributed Data
- Akka Cluster Sharding
- Akka Persistence
- AngularJS
- Cassandra
- Scala
- etcd

## Usage

- Important: Reactive Flows makes use of [server-sent events](https://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource) and [advanced JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find) which aren't available for all browsers, so make sure to use Firefox > 25.0, Safari > 7.1 or Chrome > 45.0
- To run a single node, simply execute `reStart` in an sbt session; you can shutdown the app with `reStop`
- To run multiple nodes, build a Docker image with `docker:publishLocal` and execute  the script `bin/run-reactive-flows.sh` without an argument or a number from [0, 10)
- As the names and labels of the flows aren't persisted, you have to create them after the app has started; see below examples
- Important: Reactive Flows uses [ConstructR](https://github.com/hseeberger/constructr) for initializing the cluster; make sure etcd is started and available
- Important: Reactive Flows uses the Cassandra plugin for Akka Persistence; make sure Cassandra is started and available under the configured contact point
